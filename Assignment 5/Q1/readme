The main difficulty of this code is how to decide whether the ray goes through the primitive, if it does, what is the distance.

The method used in the program is Newton's algorithm, that uses one point to estimate the root of a certain equation. So it is basically, a bisection algorithm with only one point.

The code does not only provide an orthogonal view, but the view can be customarilly set by user, so I guess it's kinda superior. 

However, there is one issue about this code, that is, it performs poorly when t & q has a value less than 1.
